## System Architecture

1. **Input Processing**:
   - Text → Sentence Transformer embeddings
   - Images → CNN feature extraction

2. **Cross-Modal Fusion**:
   - Multi-head attention between modalities
   - Generates joint representations

3. **Reinforcement Learning**:
   - ε-greedy policy
   - Experience replay with real rewards
   - Continuous action space

4. **Distributed Training**:
   - Synchronized across multiple GPUs
   - Efficient data parallelism

5. **Model Export**:
   - ONNX format for deployment
   - Quantized models for edge devices

## How to Run

```bash
# Single-GPU mode
python hybrid_ai.py

# Multi-GPU training (4 GPUs)
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nprocs=4 hybrid_ai.py

# Expected Output:
# [GPU0] Action: generate_response, Reward: 0.8
# [GPU0] Exported ONNX models to:
#        - text_encoder.onnx
#        - image_encoder.onnx  
#        - cross_modal_quant.onnx
```

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready hybrid AI system with all features and optimizations. The code is structured for easy extension and deployment across various hardware configurations.
